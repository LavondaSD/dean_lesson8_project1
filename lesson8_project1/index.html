            <p>As more technology becomes available to us, it changes the way we live our day-to-day lives.
            An example of this is how we have evolved from the everyday store stroll or mall mob to buying as we please in the comfort of our own homes with just the click of a button.
            On a positive aspect, digital marketing has become an essential tool for those of us who do not like leaving the house as much, such as myself.
            A few apparel and retail businesses seemed to be loosing the attention of their target audiences decreasing the foot traffic in their stores and ultimately affecting the companies income and sales.
            This could possibly be seen as a negative affect online shopping.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>The increasing use E-commerce as a channel for distribution has been adopted by almost every retail store.
            The advantage these stores have over the conventional few is by using the online marketing platform, they now
            have a wider, more reachable target audience. Electronic marketong gives sellers th eopportunity to relay product information to potential buyers.
            Also, electronic transactions allows the the customer preferences to be determined and could further assist in target advertisig.
            Online shopping is most convenient for those who like price comparisons.
            Since most of the stores product information is online, it is a quicker and less of hassle experience to find it at the consumer sought price.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Although sitting in bed with a glass of orange juice may sound like the best way to shop, there are some downsides to the online market world.
            The growing need for personalized customer experiences is still prominent. Ensuring a customers satisfaction is more challenger through platforms then in person innteractions.
            Digital campaigning may reach a vast audience, but without measuring results
            its hard to determine if the efforts were effective or if they were unnoticed. 
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>Online marketing can have both positive or negative results for retailers.
            If retailers properly collect data and analyze their target audience after producing marketing campigns
            , then they have accurately and efficiently used digital marketing. If the promotions are not
            producing the number a company would like to see, then it campaign may have uneffective.
            Despite the pros and cons of electronic transactions, what will remain is the demand for
            outstanding customer service. However, you accomplish it, online or in person, this will leave the greatest impression on
            consumers.
